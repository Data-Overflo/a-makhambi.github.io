<p style="text-align:justify">In this HR Diversity and Inclusion analysis project, I designed a Power BI dashboard report and formulated measures to define relevant KPIs to track and evaluate the organization's diversity initiatives. I analyzed various demographic characteristics, such as gender, age, nationality and utilized the data to calculate critical metrics to gain valuable insights into the organization's diversity and inclusion efforts.</p>

This predictive model predicts the dataset from auto insurance either the claims is fraudulent or not. This will be a binary classification task and I will demonstrate few auto ML model using Dataiku DSS Platform like Logistic Regression, and Random Forest</p>

All entertainment websites or online stores have millions of items. It becomes challenging for the customer to select the right one. At this place, recommender systems come into the picture and help the user to find the right item by minimizing the options.

Recommendation Systems in the world of machine learning have become very popular and are a huge advantage to tech giants like Netflix, Amazon and many more to target their content to a specific audience. These recommendation engines are so strong in their predictions that they can dynamically alter the state of what the user sees on their page based on the userâ€™s interaction with the app.

## The business objective for us is:

* To create a Collaborative Filtering based Movie Recommendation System
* Predict the rating that a user would give to a movie that he has not yet rated
* Minimize the difference between predicted and actual rating (RMSE and MAPE) </p>
